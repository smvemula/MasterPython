What is a class?

class is a way of defining what all properties a class can have and what all actions(functions) it can perform

What is a instance of a class?

Instance is a kind of class that actually has values and can actually peform actions with the values and its functions

Analogy for class?

I think class is like a skelton of a human being, it defnies the structure of our body and all the different parts show the various functions we can perform like moving our hands or walking.

But an instance of a class is a living human being with a life(memory created) and can actually perform actions
